                                    a valuable option to test different market segments for fit, but expectations should
                                    be reserved while you attempt to find or refine market-fit. It takes time.

                                    behalf, then we are not a good fit. If your measure of the value of our service is
                                    in some way based on email volume, then you’re probably not a good fit. The optimal
                                    daily email limit that we employ will be based entirely on how well we are
                                    delivering to the inboxes of your customer persona. Inbox placement and
                                    deliverability come first.

                                    feel that and understand the stress, we can’t deliver a solution to meet those
                                    expectations. We find that engagements don’t start or progress well when everything
                                    quickly turns to short-term thinking. The engagement will degrade as expectations
                                    simply cannot be managed or met. Even once we stand up this program, warm up
                                    mailboxes, optimize email copy and then start getting replies… 99% of those
                                    “interested” replies will only be the start of a conversation. You still need to run
                                    the ball down the field from there and close the sale. At the end of the day this is
                                    still a sales cycle and our service is at the top of the funnel.

The bulk of your involvement will be during the pre-launch phase while we get up to speed on your product, org and value proposition. After the launch we’ll collaborate with you to optimize your results, but for the most part you’ll define a primary contact that we’ll introduce interested prospects to after they reply to your outreach.</span>

                        <span>We routinely work with inside sales teams to help generate prospects that ultimately get forwarded to full-desk sales reps and BDRs for further qualification and opportunity building. It doesn’t necessarily have to be one or the other. But if it is, you’ll quickly find that in the current market it can be very expensive to hire and onboard an inside sales rep or sales team. All without any guarantees, other than payroll.

                        <span>Too many variables to say. We’re asked this quite a bit but a better question that aligns with our services would be “how many meetings can I expect?”. Some products and services fall flat and generate minimal interest with only one viable meeting per month, while others can generate 3-4 meetings per week. Reach out to us for a more detailed discussion.

                        <span>CaC will vary greatly among every product and service. We recommend a minimum LTV or ACV of $2,500.00 to make Autopilot a viable option. Comparable services to Autopilot that work on a pay-per-lead model, typically charge $350 - $650 per identified lead or meeting. Our fixed rate offers the potential to acquire leads at a much lower cost per lead, while offering predictable costs.

                                <span>Our Done-For-You Growth Services can be a powerful add-on for B2B startups, founder-led sales operations and can successfully augment existing sales teams that just don’t have time to build top of the funnel lead flow. We align best with orgs or founders that know their ideal customer and have already sold their products or services to customers. In other words, a playbook exists and we’re helping to scale reach and awareness. From a revenue perspective we recommend an annual contract value (ACV) or lifetime value (LTV) of at least $5,000.00 for our DFY Growth Services to make economical sense. Our program is designed to deliver interested prospects and spark conversations. We are not delivering sales-ready leads, although from time to time we may catch someone that is currently in-market. But those prospects and discoveries using cold outreach are typically outliers.  </span>

                                <span>This depends on you and your ability to set realistic expectations. If you don’t yet have experience or a track record of selling into a specific market, you can expect a much longer time-to-value or time-to-reply. Without a track record and identified market-fit for a customer persona, we will be essentially starting from scratch and doing a lot of experimentation. Things to consider are the buying committee (titles and roles to target), messaging and the specific value proposition (some orgs have a few to choose from) that resonate. When you come to the table knowing who your customers are and how to sell to them, we’re basically extending the reach of your existing playbook. That’s much faster. If you’re coming to the table with just a product or service and no track record, that’s OK, but expect a long ramp up period and experimentation before there are any results.

                                    mailboxes. At the optimal daily delivery rate (30 - 55 emails / mailbox) you can
                                    expect to deliver 180 - 330 emails safely per day. However, it’s not that simple and
                                    those figures are just estimates.

                                    The optimal daily email output per mailbox will greatly depend on the types of
                                    companies you’re reaching in your persona. Banking, Finance, Healthcare, Fortune
                                    500, Large nationwide or global companies generally have much more aggressive email
                                    filtering and typically require a slower daily email output. Larger buying
                                    committees that include multiple contacts from the same company, using the same
                                    email domain must also be sent to at a slower pace. As we can’t deliver to the same
                                    domain with any velocity that could appear automated. Emails that get delivered to
                                    the spam/bulk/junk folder have a significantly lower chance of ever being seen, let
                                    alone replied to. Our primary focus is inbox delivery, first and foremost.
